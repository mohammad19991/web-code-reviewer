  qa_web: `Cypress Web Automation Checks (only if visible in diff; do not assume unseen code)

Suggestions (internal qa-frontend-cypress architectural best practices):
- Action/utility methods in spec.js files → Anchor: action methods, utility functions, or reusable logic blocks in spec.js. Fix: consider moving to CC files and importing, keep spec.js for test scenarios only.
- Inline test data instead of using helpers → Anchor: hardcoded test data in spec files when reusable helpers exist. Fix: use customHelpers/[module] functions for data generation when appropriate.
- Not using localizedStrings → Anchor: hardcoded text strings in tests/CC. Fix: import from fixtures/localizedStrings/[module]/.
- Reimplementing existing helper logic → Anchor: duplicated logic that exists in customHelpers. Fix: import and use existing helper functions.
- Not using environment configuration helpers → Anchor: hardcoded environment-specific values. Fix: use posConfiguration or environment helpers.

Suggestions (general cypress/web automation best practices):
- Missing cy.session() for authentication → Anchor: repeated login without session caching. Fix: use cy.session() for authentication flows.
- Long hardcoded waits (≥ 5000ms) → Anchor: cy.wait(number) call where number ≥ 5000. Fix: consider using cy.intercept() or conditional waits with cy.should().
- Excessive test methods (>150 lines) → Anchor: test function exceeding 150 lines with complex logic. Fix: break into smaller, focused test cases or extract helper methods.

Note: Use post-patch line numbers for precise anchoring.`,

  qa_android: `Appium Android Automation Checks (only if visible in diff; do not assume unseen code)

Suggestions (internal qa-android architectural best practices):
- Manual gesture implementation when utility exists → Anchor: custom swipe/scroll code when MobileGesturesUtil is available. Fix: use MobileGesturesUtil.swipeLeftOnElement(), scrollToElement() methods.
- Manual wait implementation when utility exists → Anchor: Thread.sleep() or custom WebDriverWait in screen classes when WebDriverWaitUtils exists. Fix: use WebDriverWaitUtils.waitUntilVisibilityOfElement().
- Hardcoded test data when constants available → Anchor: literal strings when corresponding [Module]CV constants exist in project. Fix: use existing Constants classes for consistent test data.

Suggestions (general appium/android automation best practices):
- Large test methods (>150 lines) → Anchor: test method exceeding 150 lines with complex logic. Fix: break into smaller, focused test cases or extract helper methods.
- Suboptimal locator strategies → Anchor: className or complex XPath locators when accessibility-id or resource-id are available. Fix: prefer accessibility-id for better reliability and maintenance.

Note: Use post-patch line numbers for precise anchoring.`,

  qa_backend: `RestAssured API Testing Checks (only if visible in diff; do not assume unseen code)

Suggestions (internal qa-backend architectural best practices):
- Not using Activator/Service pattern → Anchor: direct RestAssured calls in test methods or repeated API logic. Fix: extract to Activator/Service classes in activators or services package.
- Not using existing test data patterns → Anchor: hardcoded test data when project has TestDataProviders, validDataFaker, or Constants available. Fix: use existing data generation patterns (validDataFaker.fillObject(), TestDataProviders, or Constants).
- Missing proper database abstraction → Anchor: direct database queries or connections in tests. Fix: use database connector classes, repositories, or connection utilities.
- Missing helper/utility pattern for complex scenarios → Anchor: complex test logic directly in @Test methods. Fix: extract to helper classes, service classes, or utility methods for better maintainability.

Suggestions (general API automation best practices):
- Long hardcoded waits (5000-9999ms) → Anchor: Thread.sleep() call where 5000 ≤ duration < 10000. Fix: consider using await() with proper retry logic or polling mechanisms, or document if needed for async operations.
- Large test methods (>100 lines) → Anchor: test method exceeding 100 lines. Fix: break into smaller, focused test cases or use helper methods.
- Missing timeout configurations → Anchor: HTTP requests without timeout settings. Fix: add appropriate timeout configurations for network calls.
- Not reusing authentication tokens efficiently → Anchor: repeated authentication calls. Fix: cache and reuse authentication tokens across test sessions.
- Missing proper test data cleanup strategies → Anchor: test data creation without cleanup mechanisms. Fix: implement @AfterEach or @AfterAll cleanup for test data.

Note: Use post-patch line numbers for precise anchoring.`

const LANGUAGE_SPECIFIC_CHECKS = {
  js: `

JavaScript/TypeScript Checks (only if visible in diff; do not assume unseen code)
React:
- Unstable hook deps (useEffect/useMemo/useCallback) when deps omit referenced vars or include unstable inline values. Anchor hook + deps. Default: evidence_strength=3, confidence=0.7.
- Heavy work in render (expensive ops in component/JSX). Anchor call chain. Default: 3, 0.7 (cap to 2, 0.5 if data size unknown).
- Missing cleanup in useEffect for subscriptions/timers/sockets. Anchor effect body; Default: 4, 0.8.
- dangerouslySetInnerHTML: user-controlled → auto-critical (security); static → suggestion.
- Index-as-key in dynamic lists. Anchor JSX key; Default: 2, 0.5.
- Un-memoized context values/expensive props passed deep; consider useMemo/useCallback. Default: 2–3, 0.5–0.7.
- Consider React.lazy/Suspense for clearly large modules.

TypeScript:
- any/unknown leakage across module boundaries (exports). Anchor export signature. Default: 3, 0.7.
- Unsafe narrowing/non-null (!) where undefined is possible. Default: 3, 0.7.
- Ambient/global type mutations widening types. Default: 3, 0.6.

Fetch/IO:
- Missing AbortController/timeout on fetch/axios; no cancellation for long-lived calls. Default: 3, 0.7.
- No retry/backoff for critical idempotent calls. Default: 2, 0.5.
- Leaking subscriptions/websockets or unbounded setInterval. Default: 4, 0.8 if no cleanup.
- URL.createObjectURL without revokeObjectURL. Default: 3, 0.7.

Performance:
- N+1 renders/effects (loop-triggered state/effects). Default: impact=2, exploitability=2, likelihood=2, blast_radius=1, evidence_strength=2, confidence=0.5–0.7.
- O(n^2) work in render over props/state. Default: impact=3, exploitability=2, likelihood=2, blast_radius=2, evidence_strength=3, confidence=0.7.
- Large lists without virtualization when clearly large. Default: impact=2, exploitability=2, likelihood=2, blast_radius=1, evidence_strength=2, confidence=0.5.
- Event burst control (debounce/throttle in high-frequency handlers: onChange, scroll, resize, keypress):
  • Mitigation present but effectiveness unknown (definition/cleanup not shown):
    impact=1, exploitability=1, likelihood=1, blast_radius=1, evidence_strength=2, confidence=0.5
    ⇒ severity_proposed="suggestion", cap severity_score ≤ 2.00
  • Mitigation proven ineffective (IneffectiveProof satisfied) with heavy work observed:
    impact=3–4, exploitability=3, likelihood=3, blast_radius=2, evidence_strength=3–4, confidence=0.7–0.8
    ⇒ may be "critical" only if severity_score ≥ 3.60
  • Effective mitigation clearly shown (stable memo/ref and reasonable wait ≥ ~100–200ms for text input; optional .cancel() cleanup):
    impact=0, exploitability=0, likelihood=0, blast_radius=0, evidence_strength=2, confidence=0.5
    ⇒ "suggestion" (e.g., consider .cancel() or adjust wait) or no issue
  • To propose "critical", include a ≤12-line snippet showing BOTH the high-frequency handler path AND at least one IneffectiveProof condition.
  • If IneffectiveProof is not anchored, you MUST NOT propose "critical".

Security (additional):
- User-controlled URLs in navigation APIs without validation. Default: 3, 0.6 (critical only if taint is clear).
- Tokens stored in localStorage/sessionStorage → auto-critical unless strong mitigations. Anchor storage write. Default: 4–5, 0.8.
- URL.createObjectURL used with untrusted blobs without checks. Default: 3, 0.6.

Accessibility:
- Only mark critical if core flows are blocked; otherwise suggestion with evidence_strength ≤ 2.

Note: Use post-patch line numbers. If only diff hunk is known or source is uncertain, set evidence_strength ≤ 2 and confidence ≤ 0.5, and prefix fix_code_patch with "// approximate".
